 * decides and the two paths do not overlap:
 *
 *   - `github` — code, through a pull request on GitHub. Open source we
 *     maintain, open source we recommend, and builders' products that take PRs.
 *   - `role` — joining a builders' product in a named role (design, product,
 *     research, content, engineering…), asked for and answered on this site.
 *
 * A product that does both is listed once on each path, with the action that
 * path needs, and each entry says whether it also takes the other kind of help.
 * `source` says whether the maintainers are here — one of us, so somebody you
 * can reach — or a repository from outside that one of us recommends.
 *
 * Pure, so the unit tests read it directly.
