/**
 * Netlify's CDN keeps the public pages for guests.
 *
 * Every page here renders per request — the root layout reads the language
 * and theme cookies — so without this each view of the home page, a profile
 * or a share card woke the server function, and crawlers made sure there were
 * views around the clock. A guest's page is the same for every guest who
 * picked the same language and theme, so the CDN can answer it: the server
 * renders each address about once an hour, and stale copies are served while
 * it does.
 *
 * Only for guests. The rule applies when the request carries no Supabase
 * session cookie, and the session cookies are in `Netlify-Vary` too, so a
 * signed-in member never matches a guest's copy and always gets their own,
 * fresh page. That is also why a member sees their own edit at once; guests
 * see it within the hour. GitHub activity itself only changes every six hours
 * (20261106000000_github_activity_every_six_hours.sql).
 *
 * `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` keeps a `Netlify-CDN-Cache-Control` the response
 * already has and merges our `Netlify-Vary` with its own, which already keys
 * React Server Component requests apart from documents.
